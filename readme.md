# PokéBattler
This **React** app was created in collaboration by [Christina](https://github.com/christinamcmahon) and [Eli](https://github.com/eliastooloee) at Flatiron School. The [backend](https://github.com/christinamcmahon/pokemon-battler-backend) was made with **Ruby on Rails**. **Material UI** was used for styling. Pokémon data was pulled from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
